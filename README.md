# svs_to_tif_converter
A useful python based tool to convert .svs to .tif file. Currently there is an issue with the Bioformats importer in FIJI as a result it is not possible to convert the .svs file to .tif file. This tools utilizes the openslide package to do the conversion and the good part is thqt there is no compression during the conversion so no data loss issue.
